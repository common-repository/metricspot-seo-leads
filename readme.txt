With MetricSpot's SEO Leads Plugin you will be able to offer free SEO reports on your own website. Automate the process of capturing SEO leads!

== Description ==

This plugin inserts <a href="https://metricspot.com/seo-leads/">MetricSpot's SEO Leads</a> script in your WordPress site so you don't have to edit your theme's code. It's the first step you need to take in order to embed our lead generation widgets in your website.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, you can insert our widgets in your website by pasting the following code snippets where you want them to appear:

<strong>Sidabar Widget</strong>
`&lt;div id="ms-audit" data-ms-id="{your_id}" data-ms-lang="en" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

<strong>Inline Widget</strong>
`&lt;div class="ms-inline" data-ms-id="{your_id}" data-ms-lang="en" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

<strong>Popup Widget</strong>
`&lt;div id="ms-popup" data-ms-id="{your_id}" data-ms-lang="en" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

Remember to replace the `{your_id}` by your MetricSpot's user ID on the above snippets. If you don't know your MetricSpot's user ID you can obtain it from our website.

To use this plugin you have to be a <strong>Pro user of MetricSpot’s tools</strong>. <a href="https://metricspot.com/contact/">Send us a message</a> with your registration e-mail and we’ll give you a free one week trial.
